<p>This repo is to record my progress on Berkeley's cs61a (Spring 2011) course.

<p>A few notes for anyone reading this:
<ul>
<li>This is entirely a personal project, however I have made it public in case it helps anyone else.</li>
<li>Unless stated otherwise, my solutions are intended to be complete and working. However, I am a student working on my own, so I can't guarantee it. If you're using this as reference material, evaluate it for yourself and compare against other resources online.</li>
<li>The course is no longer taught in Scheme, so there is probably little risk of cheating, but obligatory disclaimer: don't use this to cheat, don't pass this off as your own.</li>
</ul>
