; Louis' program produces the answer list in reverse order because
; it computes the first list item first, and then appends it to the start of the
; 'answer' list - not the end. As each item of the list is appended to the start of
; the 'answer' list, it reverses the order. It's a first-in, last-out order.

; Louis' fix also doesn't work because it seems to break the structure of the list -
; the car of the first pair is nil, and the cdr is the value (rather than a list pointer).
; I can't actually see how this would construct a list at all.
